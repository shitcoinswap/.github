# Introducing: Smartcoin, the open-source trading platform.

Thank you so much for you interest in the Shitcoin Society. Today, we are very happy and proud to announce Smartcoin, the open-source trading platform.

Being open-source, Smartcoin will make it easy for blockchain developers to integrate with our exchange. New network integrations can be developed and submitted via a pull request - a first in the world of blockchain.
