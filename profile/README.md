We are building the worlds most awesome open-source trading platform. And with $RST (our revenue share token), you can be a part of it.

Congratulations! You are a part of the Shitcoin Society. Soon you'll be able to redeem your code on shitcoinsociety.com, and include your wallet address in our genesis ledger (see below).

## Roadmap

The development of the Shitcoin Society platform happens in three stages:

### Stage 1

Development of open source trading platform, allowing for trade of $RST in a centralized manner.

### Stage 2

Migration of centralized $RST to a blockchain token.

### Stage 3

Launch of new layer 1 blockchain, using $RST holder addresses to seed the genesis block.
