# Shitcoin Society is sunsetting

Thank you so much for you interest in the Shitcoin Society. We are both happy and sad to announce that the Shitcoin Society will be sunsetting, as we focus our efforts on supporting the [SmartCoin Development Foundation](https://www.smartcoin.dev). See you on the other side.

## You got one of these?
