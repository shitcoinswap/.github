# Welcome to the Shitcoin Society

We are building the open-source alternative to Coinbase, Kraken, etc.

For this purpose we are issuing the Revenue Share Token ($RST). The allocation is as follows:

- 20% of all $RST will be made available for direct sale on [Shitcoin Swap](https://www.shitcoinswap.com)
- 20% of all $RST will be allocated to [idiot.finance](https://idiot.finance) holders.
- 20% of all $RST will be handed out as code redemption cards at conferences.
- 40% remains unallocated for future use
